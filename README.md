[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-1.2.0-blue?style=for-the-badge)](#)

**Chat With Cline** is a world-class command center designed for the [Cline CLI](https://docs.cline.bot). It transitions raw terminal agentic logic into a high-end visual dashboard, enabling you to build and manage your own **Virtual AI Team**.

---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
Developed as a "Tactical Command Center", this dashboard emphasizes architectural clarity and the ability to deploy specialized "Expert Instances" for complex software projects.

## 🛠 Features (v1.2.0 - Advanced Team Builder)

### 1. Virtual Team Orchestration
- **Expert Configuration**: Deploy specialized roles (e.g., "Frontend Architect", "Security Auditor") using a robust deployment form. Configure Provider, Model, Temperature, and Base URLs individually.
- **Expert Renaming**: Double-click any agent tab to rename roles on the fly.
- **Multi-Agent Persistence**: Your entire team, their message history, and their specialized configurations are automatically saved to `localStorage`. Refresh without losing your "Neural Employees".

### 2. Status Telemetry & Real-time Monitoring
- **Visual Indicators**: Dynamic headers featuring specialized status dots:
  - 🟢 **Online**: Ready for directives.
  - 🔵 **Busy (Pulsing)**: Neural processing in progress.
  - 🔴 **Error (Flashing)**: System failure or API blockage.
  - 🔘 **Offline**: Internal disconnect.

### 3. Tactical Cognitive Layers
- **Rules Tab**: Define persistent behavioral constraints across your project.
- **Skills Matrix**: Enable or disable specialized capabilities like *Scraping*, *DevOps*, and *Unit Testing*.
- **Integrated Terminal**: Execute and monitor commands directly from the dashboard.

## 📜 Usage & Persistence

The "Chat With Cline" interface is built for longevity. All configurations, including:
- **Agents & Their Roles**
- **Project Rules**
- **Task Lists**
- **Active Skills**

Are persisted locally. This allows you to build a complex project structure and return to it exactly where you left off, with your specialized virtual team ready to execute.

---

## 📜 Installation

1. **Prerequisite**: Ensure the [Cline CLI](https://docs.cline.bot/cline-cli/installation) is installed globally.
2. **Key Config**: Export your provider keys (e.g., `CLINE_API_KEY`).
3. **Local Providers**: Full support for `Ollama` and `LM Studio` via the tactical deployment matrix.
